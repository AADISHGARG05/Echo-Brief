This text summarizer is fully operational and has been constructed using Python libraries including NLTK, Tinker, and GTTS. 
It has been created without the use of AI methodologies, opting instead for basic Python features such as if-else loops to detect particular words and generate summaries. 
Moreover, it enhances comprehension by converting the summarized text into an MP3 file, adding uniqueness and appeal to the project.
